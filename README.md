## dbt_snowflake_project

A data project where I used DBT and Snowflake.


## Project Overview

This project is a complete ELT pipeline built using **dbt** (Data Build Tool) and **Snowflake**, designed to demonstrate modern data engineering practices including data modeling, testing, documentation, and environment management using Python virtual environments.
